                                    The concept of Trainsquare was born before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the unfolding of the pandemic further solidified the need for in-person interactions in the local community.

                                    Founder and CEO, Nadeen Awwad, and the co-founders created Trainsquare because they see a need for tech-enabled solutions to promote in-person interactions and build community.

                                    While online communities give us the illusion of connection, research repeatedly reminds us that in-person social interactions are critical for our well-being.
                                    
                                    The Trainsquare team believes they can contribute to bringing the community together through in-person, hands-on, interactive group workshops. Trainsquare is launching in Abu Dhabi soon with an ambitious plan to expand globally.
